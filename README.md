### Hi there :wave:

I’m Nityan. I build lots of artificial intelligence based solutions for the toughest problems in the world.

I work at ⚡ [Noodle.ai](https://www.noodle.ai) as a :star2: Data Scientist.

I’m currently learning concepts behind :shamrock: `Reinforcement Learning`.

Currently working on lot of things from :telescope: Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision to Time Series Forecasting.

Look out :nerd_face: for lot of new content coming your way - [Data Structures, Algorithms with Python], [Machine Learning Algorithms and Pipelines].

For more information about me (and a whole lot of shenanigans), check out [Portfolio](https://github.com/nityansuman) ande connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumar-nityan-suman/)
